# Decentralized Identity Verification 

A system to verify identities without relying on a central authority. Users can prove their identity through attestations stored on the blockchain.

__Note:__I'll provide a high-level outline of a Solidity smart contract for Decentralized Identity Verification, focusing on the basic structure and functionalities. Please note that this is a simplified implementation for educational purposes and might require further development and security audits for use in a production environment.

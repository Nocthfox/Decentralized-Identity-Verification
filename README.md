# Decentralized Identity Verification 

A system to verify identities without relying on a central authority. Users can prove their identity through attestations stored on the blockchain.

__Note:__I'll provide a high-level outline of a Solidity smart contract for Decentralized Identity Verification, focusing on the basic structure and functionalities. Please note that this is a simplified implementation for educational purposes and might require further development and security audits for use in a production environment.

Explanation:

The contract defines a IdentityRecord struct to store user identity data, including their user ID, full name, document URI (link to identity document on IPFS or elsewhere), and the number of attestations received.

Users can request identity verification by calling the requestIdentityVerification function and providing their full name and document URI.

Attesters can attest to a user's identity using the attestIdentity function. They can specify the attestation type (e.g., KYC, email verification) during attestation.

The contract maintains an array of Attestation structs to store all attestations made by attesters.

The contract has a isAttester function to check whether an address is an authorized attester.

The getIdentityRecord function allows users to view their own identity record.

Please note that this implementation is a simplified version, and a real-world Decentralized Identity Verification system would require additional features, such as identity revocation, reputation systems, and more sophisticated attestation mechanisms. Also, ensure you implement the isAttester function with appropriate access control mechanisms to ensure only authorized entities can attest identities. Always conduct thorough testing and ensure security before deploying smart contracts in a production environment.
